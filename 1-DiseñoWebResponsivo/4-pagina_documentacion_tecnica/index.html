                                    <h3>SCSS</h3>
                                    <p>The SCSS syntax uses the file extension .scss. With a few small exceptions, it’s a superset of CSS, which means essentially all valid CSS is valid SCSS as well. Because of its similarity to CSS, it’s the easiest syntax to get used to and the most popular.</p>
                                    <p>SCSS looks like this:</p>
        
                                    <code>@mixin button-base() {
                                        @include typography(button);
                                        @include ripple-surface;
                                        @include ripple-radius-bounded;
                                    
                                        display: inline-flex;
                                        position: relative;
                                        height: $button-height;
                                        border: none;
                                        vertical-align: middle;
                                    
                                        &:hover { cursor: pointer; }
                                    
                                        &:disabled {
                                        color: $mdc-button-disabled-ink-color;
                                        cursor: default;
                                        pointer-events: none;
                                        }
                                    }</code>

                                    <h3>Input Encoding</h3>
                                    <p>It’s often the case that a document is initially available only as a sequence of bytes, which must be decoded into Unicode. Sass performs this decoding as follows:
                                        <ul>
                                            <li> If the sequence of bytes begins with the UTF-8 or UTF-16 encoding of U+FEFF BYTE ORDER MARK, the corresponding encoding is used.</li>
                                            <li> If the sequence of bytes begins with the plain ASCII string @charset, Sass determines the encoding using step 2 of the CSS algorithm for determining the fallback encoding.</li>
                                            <li>Otherwise, UTF-8 is used.</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    </p>
                                    <h3>Parse Errors</h3>
                                    <p>When Sass encounters invalid syntax in a stylesheet, parsing will fail and an error will be presented to the user with information about the location of the invalid syntax and the reason it was invalid.</p>
                                    <p>Note that this is different than CSS, which specifies how to recover from most errors rather than failing immediately. This is one of the few cases where SCSS isn’t strictly a superset of CSS. However, it’s much more useful to Sass users to see errors immediately, rather than having them passed through to the CSS output.</p>          
                                    <p>The location of parse errors can be accessed through implementation-specific APIs. For example, in Dart Sass you can access SassException.span, and in Node Sass’s and Dart Sass’s JS API you can access the file, line, and column properties.</p>

                                <article>
                                    <p>Just like CSS, most Sass stylesheets are mainly made up of style rules that contain property declarations. But Sass stylesheets have many more features that can exist alongside these.</p>
    
                                    <h3>Statements</h3>
                                    <p>A Sass stylesheet is made up of a series of statements, which are evaluated in order to build the resulting CSS. Some statements may have blocks, defined using { and }, which contain other statements. For example, a style rule is a statement with a block. That block contains other statements, such as property declarations.</p>
                                    <p>In SCSS, statements are separated by semicolons (which are optional if the statement uses a block). In the indented syntax, they’re just separated by newlines.</p>   
        
                                    <h4>Universal Statements</h4>
                                    <p>These types of statements can be used anywhere in a Sass stylesheet:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Variable declarations, like $var: value.</li>
                                        <li>Flow control at-rules, like @if and @each.</li>
                                        <li>The @error, @warn, and @debug rules.</li>
                                    </ul>   
        
                                    <h4>CSS Statements</h4>
                                    <p>These statements produce CSS. They can be used anywhere except within a @function:</p>
                                    <ul>
                                        <li>Style rules, like h1 <code>{ /* ... */ }</code>.</li>
                                        <li>CSS at-rules, like @media and @font-face.</li>
                                        <li>Mixin uses using @include.</li>
                                        <li>The @at-root rule.</li>
                                    </ul>

                                     <h4>The way Sass comments work differs substantially between SCSS and the indented syntax. Both syntaxes support two types of comments: comments defined using /* */ that are (usually) compiled to CSS, and comments defined using // that are not.</h4>
                            
                                    <h3>In SCSS</h3>
                                    <p>Comments in SCSS work similarly to comments in other languages like JavaScript. Single-line comments start with //, and go until the end of the line. Nothing in a single-line comment is emitted as CSS; as far as Sass is concerned, they may as well not exist. They’re also called silent comments, because they don’t produce any CSS.</p>
                                    <p>Multi-line comments start with /* and end at the next */. If a multi-line comment is written somewhere that a statement is allowed, it’s compiled to a CSS comment. They’re also called loud comment, by contrast with silent comments. A multi-line comment that’s compiled to CSS may contain interpolation, which will be evaluated before the comment is compiled.</p>          
                                    <p>By default, multi-line comments be stripped from the compiled CSS in compressed mode. If a comment begins with /*!, though, it will always be included in the CSS output.</p>   
                                    <code>
                                        // This comment won't be included in the CSS.
        
                                        /* But this comment will, except in compressed mode. */
        
                                        /* It can also contain interpolation:
                                        * 1 + 1 = #{1 + 1} */
        
                                        /*! This comment will be included even in compressed mode. */
        
                                        p /* Multi-line comments can be written anywhere
                                        * whitespace is allowed. */ .sans {

                                    <h3>In SASS</h3>
                                    <p>Comments in the indented syntax work a little differently: they’re indentation-based, just like the rest of the syntax. Like SCSS, silent comments written with // are never emitted as CSS, but unlike SCSS everything indented beneath the opening // is also commented out.</p>
        
                                    <p>Indented syntax comments that start with /* work with indentation the same way, except that they are compiled to CSS. Because the extend of the comment is based on indentation, the closing */ is optional. Also like SCSS, /* comments can contain interpolation and can start with /*! to avoid being stripped in compressed mode.</p>          
                                    <p>Comments can also be used within expressions in the indented syntax. In this case, they have exactly the same syntax as they do in SCSS.</p>   
                                    <code>
                                        // This comment won't be included in the CSS.
                                        This is also commented out.
        
                                        /* But this comment will, except in compressed mode.

                                        /*! This comment will be included even in compressed mode.

                                    <p>When writing style libraries using Sass, you can use comments to document the mixins, functions, variables, and placeholder selectors that your library provides, as well as the library itself. These are comments are read by the SassDoc tool, which uses them to generate beautiful documentation. Check out the Susy grid engine’s documentation to see it in action!</p>
        
                                    <p>Documentation comments are silent comments, written with three slashes (///) directly above the thing you’re documenting. SassDoc parses text in the comments as Markdown, and supports many useful annotations to describe it in detail.</p>

They’re parsed as function calls, resolved to plain CSS functions, and compiled as-is to CSS. There are a few exceptions, though, which have special syntax that can’t just be parsed as a SassScript expression. All special function calls return unquoted strings.</h4>
            
                                    <h3>url()</h3>
                                    <p>The url() function is commonly used in CSS, but its syntax is different than other functions: it can take either a quoted or unquoted URL. Because an unquoted URL isn’t a valid SassScript expression, Sass needs special logic to parse it.</p>
                                    <p>If the url()‘s argument is a valid unquoted URL, Sass parses it as-is, although interpolation may also be used to inject SassScript values. If it’s not a valid unquoted URL—for example, if it contains variables or function calls—it’s parsed as a normal plain CSS function call.</p>
